## Simple Linear Regression Algorithm
Linear regression is a statistical approach that models the relationship between input features and output. The input features are called the independent variables, and the output is called a dependent variable. The goal here is to predict the value of the output based on the input features by multiplying it with its optimal coefficients.

## Objectives
* Using Scikit-Learn to implement Simple Linear Regression
* Here the goal is to predict the value of “co2 emissions” from the value of “engine size” in the dataset.
* Split Data into training and testing Set
* Create a Model Using Training Set
* Evaluate Model Using Test Set
* Use Model to Predict Unknown Value

## Libraries used
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Sklearn
